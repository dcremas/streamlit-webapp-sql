#### Description:

#### A Project intended to serve as a sample application to enable a user with or without any prior SQL knowledge to be able to answer in-depth questions about an internal relational database.  The database for this project is a 'live' hourly weather data store that is currently being utilized for multiple data visualizations also hosted on the web. The LangChain framework allows for the integration of many different LLM's with internal data stores. 

##### Features:

- Designing and implementing a full functioning Web Application on Heroku via Streamlit front-end.
- Harnessing a back-end Postgres database hosted on AWS RDS to enable text to SQL interactivity.
